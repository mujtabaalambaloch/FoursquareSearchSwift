# FoursquareSearchSwift

**Note: This only runs on iOS 9+ Devices**

To run simple open the **FourSquareAPI.xcworkspace**

This is a basic Foursquare Venue Search using [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [AlamorfireObjectMapper](https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper). 

Currently it searches for Food Category which can be found in the **Constants.h** file. To change the category follow the documentation on [developer.foursquare.com](https://developer.foursquare.com/categorytree)

> Foursquare API requires *ClientID* and *ClientSecret* which must be added in the **Constants.h** file under **clientID** & **clientSecret**
